## About

Git integration uses two complementary tools:

- **gitsigns.nvim** for inline indicators: changed lines in the gutter, hunk staging, inline blame
- **lazygit** opened in a floating terminal for full commit/branch/merge workflows

The combination mirrors ThePrimeagen's workflow — gitsigns for awareness while coding, lazygit for intentional git operations.
